# 1.0 Network Fundementals


## 1.1 Compare and Constract OSI and TCP/IP Models
### OSI Model: Reference Model
> "One Model to rule them all!"

In 1970s, ISO –– a standardizing organization came with a networking model that was vendor neutral. ISO is not an acronym but the Greek word for "EQUAL" meaning that all the countries that participated had an equal voice in the standardizations. This was meant to replace proprietary models for this standardized model. It had a goal of making sure that everyone computer the world could be networked together.

Name | Function | Protocols | Devices | PDU (Protocol Data Unit) while Encapsulation | PDU Name
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
L7: Application | Creats and opens the data | HTTP, HTTPs, SMTP | User Apps | L7H + Data | 
L6: Presentation | Formatting, Encryption | JPEG, ASCII, .gif, .tiff |  | L6H + L7H + Data | 
L5: Session | Synchronization, Logical Ports | SQL, NFS, NetBIOS | Logical Ports | L5H + L6H + L7H + Data | 
L4: Transport | Segmentation | TCP, UDP, SPX | Firewalls, Hosts | L4H + L5H + L6H + L7H + Data | Segment
L3: Network | Addressing | IP, IPS, ARP, ICPM | Routers | L3H + L4H + L5H + L6H + L7H + Data | Packet
L2: Data Link | Forwarding to the Next Device | Ethernet, Frame Relay, PPP, HDLC | NICs, L2 Switches | L2H + L3H + L4H + L5H + L6H + L7H + Data + FCS (Frame Check Sequence) | Frame 
L1: Physical | Media Pathways |  | Cabling, Connectors, Lights, Hubs | 110101010001011110110010101010101 | Bits

* **L1 - L4:** Prepares the data for network delivery to the destination. When troubleshooting, we focus on these layers, since we're focusing on delivery itself.
* **L5 - L7:** Prepares the data for destination to understand.

### TCP/IP Model: Networking Model
> "Language of the Internet"

Historically, it was the competing standardized networking model to the OSI. The OSI was never really implemented widely but used more as reference and TCP/IP became the widely implemented model.

* **Network Access** was too generic.


## 1.2 Compare and Constract TCP and UDP Protocols
### Transport Layer
* Transport Layer protocols provides **session multiplexing**. That is multiple applications can use the same IP address and not break the networking.
* Transport Layer protocols segment the data into manageable chunks of data for transmitting data across networks.
* Can provide for guaranteed data delivery (if TCP is used).

### TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
* Reliable - Guaranteed Data Delivery
* Connection-Oriented: Synchronizes connection between source and destination before any data is sent.
* Provides sequencing for Error Recovery.
* Uses: 80 to 90 % of traffic. e.g.: file sharing, downloading, webpages, email...
* Flow Control: It means that TCP will do the handshake per *window size* not on every packet, which prevents a slow connection.

#### TCP 3-Way Handshake
1. Sender: ```Seq:100|CTL: SYN``` to Reciever
2. Reciever: ```Seq:200/ACKSeq:101|CTL: SYN/ACK``` to Sender
3. Sender: ```Seq:102/Seq:201|CTL: ACK``` to Reciever

* *Seq:* Sequence Number
* *CTL:* Control
* *SYN:* Synchronization Flag
* *ACK:* Acknowledgement Flag

### UDP: User Datagram Protocol
* Unreliable - Best Effort Delivery
* Connectionless: No synchronization.
* Error detection (Checksum) but no Error Recovery, data packets can be dropped, and no sequencing.
* Uses: Streaming Video, Voice Traffic, Real-Time Services, etc.

## 1.3 Describe The Impact of Infrastructure Components In An Enterprise Network
### Enterprise Networking Components
> "Components that help make your network more secure!"

* **Cisco ASAs:** Create a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted network. By default allowing traffice to flow from trusted to untrusted. But by default blocks traffice from untrusted to trusted.
* **Sourcefire (today called Firepower):** Runs on dedicated hardware. NGFWs (Next-Gen Firewalls), NGIPSs (Next-Gen Intrusion Prevention Systems).
* **Access points:** Connects wireless devices to wired network. Extends the broadcast domain of the wired network. CSMA/CA (CSMA/CD).
* **Wireless controllers:** Manages multiple access points, centralizes configuration, reduces administrative redundancy, controls frequency usage, controls antennae strength.
* **Switches:** Makes forwarding decision based on Layer 2 addressing.
* **Routers:** Makes routing decisiion based on Layer 3 addressing.

## 1.4 Compare and Contrast Collapsed Core and Three-Tier Architectures
### Why Do We Need to Learn About Networking Architectures?
* Each business brings different set of circumstances that a standard network design will not work for everything.
* We cannot approach companies and clients with the idea of just throwing hardward into the mix without a plan or design. Too much is a waste and may not provide any better solution. Too little means taxing the hardware to do more than it was meant to do.
* *Scalability!!*

### Goal of Design
Provides a scalable and manageable network for the business
Cisco provides design guidelines to help

### Three-Tier Architecture
  * **Core:** Backbone
  * **Distribution:** Filtering and Routing Politics
  * **Access:** Apply Network Access Policies

  </p>

## 1.5 Compare and Contrast Network Topologies
### Star
* Used for LANs.
* Every device has a direct connection back to centralized connectivity device (usually a switch) so that one device or cable issue will not cause the rest of the network to fail.
<p align="center">
  <img src="IMGs/5.png" width="318px" height="300px">
</p>

### Mesh
* Used for WANs & Service Providers networks.
* Provides for redundancy of devices so that the failure of any single connection will not affect communications.
* Determine the number of connectioons needed: ```N(N-1)/2``` . *where N = # of nodes* 
<p align="center">
  <img src="IMGs/6.png" width="318px" height="329px">
</p>

### Hyprid
* Custom
* Provides redundancy for critical services but also single connectivity for devices that are not critical but necessary.
* E.g.: We might provide a full mesh for our database servers or virtualization services. So, we provide single links to access switches for users on workstations.
<p align="center">

## 1.6 Select The Appropriate Cabling Type Based on Implementation Requirements
### Fiber
* Very long distances, but seeing it more on the LAN as well
* Human hair is 50 microns, Fiber core is 9 microns in single mode, and 62.6 micron in multimode
* Construction:
  * Core
  * Cladding industry standard at 125 microns
  * Buffer
* Types:
  * Single mode fiber: tighter cladding = smaller core, one mode of light propagates
  * Multi-mode fiber: looser, larger core allows multiple light particles, less distance
* Connectors:
  * SC
  * LC
  * ST
  * FC
  * MTRJ

  * Switch to PC
  * Router to Switch

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="IMGs/8.png" width="918px" height="629px" style="display: inline;">
</p>

#### Crossover
* Usage: 
  * Switch to Switch (autodetect on most switches will work with straight-through cables, but crossover is the correct choice -AutoMDIX)
  * Router to Router
  * Router to PC

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="IMGs/9.png" width="918px" height="629px" style="display: inline;">

## 1.9 Compare and Contrast IPv4 Address Types
### IP (Internet Protocol) Addressing –– IPv4
* Works on Layer 3 of the OSI
* Works on the Internet Layer of the TCP/IP
* 32-bit Binary Number (Identifier)
* Reported in Dotted Decimal: e.g. 192.168.1.10 (4 octets –– 4 sets of 8 bits)
* **2 Portions:**
  * **NetworkID:** Logical Grouping
  * **HostID:** Unique Identifier within that Group
* Number of Addresses: 4.3 Billion

### Unicast Addresses
* Single IP Address (Source IP address or Destination IP)
* A to B
* One to One
* They must be unique within the same subnet (logical grouping of addresses)
  * No duplicates within the same subnet
  * TCP

### Broadcast Addresses
* Single IP Addrss, it's special –– it's not assigned to any one device
* Every device within a subnet listens for traffic sent to the broadcast addrss
* One to All
* UDP
* ARP, DHCP

### Multicast Addrsses
* Neither Unicast or Broadcast
* Subset of a broadcast
* One to Many

### Addressing Goal
Data from source to destination.

### MAC Addresses
* **Acronyms:**
  * Media Access Control 
  * BIA: Burn-in Addrss
  * In MS world: Physical Address
* 48-bit (Trillions of devices think they're on the same network)
* Connot communicate with someone on a differnet network
* **Design of the address:**
  * **1st 24bits:** OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
  * **2nd 24bits:** UID (Unique Identifier)
* Works on Layer 2 of the OSI
* Works on the Network Access Layer of the TCP/IP

### Binary
* Binary will reveal the NetworkID and the BroadcastID
  * Are not assigned to any one device on a network
  * **NetworkID:** the HOST bits are all binary zeros
  * **BroadcastID:** the HOST bits are all binary ones

## 1.10 Describe the need for private IPv4 addressing
Not long after the classes the 4.3 billion addresses was clearly not enough. The pool depleted rapidly, a few approaches were developed to address the problem.
* NAT
* VLSM
* IPv6

### Private IP Addressing (RFC 1918)

Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask 
------------ | ------------ | ------------
Class A | ```10.0.0.1 - 10.255.255.254``` | ```255.0.0.0```
Class B | ```172.16.0.1 - 172.31.255.254``` | ```255.240.0.0```
Class C | ```192.168.0.1 - 192.168.255.254``` | ```255.255.0.0```

## 1.11 Identify The Appropriate IPv6 Addressing Scheme to Satisfy Addressing Requirements in a LAN/WAN Environment
### IPv6 Scheme
* IPv4 Replacement
* 128 bit (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456) –– Still Binary
* Reported in Double Dotted Hexadecimal Format: e.g. ```2001:abcd:1234:ef01:0234:56ff:fe79:abcd/64```
* **2 Portions:**
  * **NetworkID**
  * **InterfaceID** 

### IPv6 Compression Rules
1. Empty double dotted can only appear one time.
  * Right: ```2001[::]1234:ef01:0234[:0:]fe79:abcd```
  * Wrong: ```2001[::]1234:ef01:0234[::]fe79:abcd```
2. Contriguous set: if multiple sets are zeros, they all getting compressed as long as they are side by side.
  * e.g. ```2001[::]0234:1234:fe79:abcd```
3. Can't remove zeros in between two numbers.
  * Right: ```2[00]1:abcd:1234:ef01:0234:56ff:fe79:abcd```
  * Wrong: ```2[]1:abcd:1234:ef01:0234:56ff:fe79:abcd```
4. Can remove leading zeros.
  * e.g. ```2001:abcd:1234:000:234:ff:fe79:abcd```

## 1.12 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot IPv6 Addressing
### CLI Commands
**Show**
* ```show ipv6 interface brief``` – *Self-Explanatory.*

**Interface Configuration**
* ```ipv6 unicast-routing``` – Essential command in order to use IPv6.
* ```ipv6 address <ip/sm>``` – Specifying an IPv6 address with a subnet mask.
* ```ipv6 enable``` – Activating interface.
* ```no shutdown``` – Turning on an interface.
* ```no ipv6 address <ip/sm>``` – Removing an IPv6 address from an interface.

## 1.13 Configure and Verify IPv6 Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC)
Stateless Address Auto Configuration or SLAAC is a functionality of IPv6 that doesn’t have a counterpart in IPv4. It is a method of providing global unicast IPv6 addresses to clients from the local router without the use of a DHCP server. In this exercise, you will implement and verify SLAAC.
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="IMGs/14.png" width="918px" height="329px" style="display: inline;">
</p>
SLAAC functions using what are called Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA) messages. The RS is sent by the client asking for addressing information, and the RA is sent as a response from the router. When a router sends an RA where the M and O flags are set to 0, this indicates to the client that SLAAC is available and IPv6 addressing information will be provided. 


### In order to enable SLAAC, these two flags must be disabled:
  * ```no ipv6 nd managed-config-flag```
  * ```no ipv6 nd other-config-flag``` 
* ```ipv6 address autoconfig``` – Enabling SLAAC.

## 1.14 Compare and Contrast IPv6 Address Types

### Unicast
Type | 64-bit | 64-bit | CIDR Notation
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
Unspecified | ```0000``` | ```::0``` | /128
Loopback | ```0000``` | ```::1``` | /128
Unique Local | ```FC00...(FD00)``` | ```::``` | /7 (/8)
IPv4 Mapped | ```...``` | ```FFFF``` | /96

* **Unspecified Address:** *Self-Explanatory* –– Default Route.
* **Loopback Address:** *Self-Explanatory* –– Helps us to test wether or not our interface is working correctly.
* **Unique Local Address (ULA):** Like Private IP Address.
* **IPv4 Mapped:** For Labs Only.

### Global Unicast
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="IMGs/11.png" width="918px" height="329px" style="display: inline;">
</p>

### Multicasts (Supercedes Broadcasts in IPv4)
Type | 64-bit | 64-bit | CIDR Notation
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
All Nodes | ```FF02``` | ```::1``` | /8
All Routers | ```FF02``` | ```::2``` | /8

### Link Local
```FE80::``` | ```...``` | /10
------------ | ------------ | ------------ 
* Not forwarded by router
* Host choose their own link local addresses
* Similar to APIPA (but useable)

### Modified EUI-64: Extended Unique Identifier
Identifying a unique **InterfaceID** using the MAC Address.
e.g. MAC Address: ```00-0C-29-B8-C8-76``` –– ```00000000:00001100:00101001:10111000:11001000:01110110```
1. We add 16 bits (FFFE) right in the middle: ```00-0C-29-[FF-FE]-B8-C8-76``` –– ```00000000:00001100:00101001[:11111111:11111010:]10111000:11001000:01110110```
2. We flip the 7th bit in the first section of the InterfaceID: ```0[2]-0C-29-[FF-FE]-B8-C8-76``` –– ```000000[1]0:00001100:00101001[:11111111:11111010:]10111000:11001000:01110110```
