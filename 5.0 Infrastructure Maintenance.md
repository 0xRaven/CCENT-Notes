# 5.0 Infrastructure Maintenance
## 5.1 Configure and Verify Device-Monitoring Using SYSLOG
Logs are being reported into two places:
1. Buffer: a small amount of RAM on a Cisco device. When it fills up, the earliest syslog messages will empty out to make room to the newest one.
* ```show buffer```

2. The Console: Real time SYSLOG messages.

### SYSLOG Message Example
Timestamp | Facility | Mnemonic | Description
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ 
Mar 19 14:10:01.052; | %LINK | UPDOWN | Line protocol on interface FastEthernet0/0, changed...


### SYSLOG Severity Levels

> The lower the severity level, the more critical is to the operation device.

### CLI Commands
* ```logging <server-ip>```


## 5.2 Configure and Verify Device Management
### Backup and Restore Device Configuration
* ```copy <source> <dest>```
  * e.g ```copy running-config startup-config```
  * e.g ```copy tftp runnig-config```
* ```copy start run``` – Trick in case of misconfiguration.

### Using Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP for device discovery
> It's either CDP or LLDP.

#### CDP
* ```show cdp```
    * The Device ID or hostname
    * The local interface on NYCORE1 on which this device is connected
    * The Holdtime which you will configure shortly
    * The Capability which is indicated by a Code for which a key is provided at the beginning of the output
    * The Platform of the device, including model number
    * The Port ID on the remote device via which it is connected to NYCORE1
* ```show cdp entry <hostname>```
* ```show cdp traffic```
* ```cdp timer <sec>```
* ```cdp holdtime <sec>```
* ```show cdp neighbors```

#### LLDP
* ```lldp run```
* ```show lldp```

#### Licensing
* ```show license all```
* ```show license feature```

## 5.3 Configure and Verify Initial Device Configuration
### Steps:
1. ```logging synchronous``` - Enable synchronous logging.
2. ```exec-timeout 0``` - Change console port time out.
3. ```hostname <hostname>``` - Configure hostname.
4. On Router: Configure IP address per interface.
5. On Switch: Configure virtual interfaces.
6. Configure RIP.
7. ```no auto-summary```
8. Configure remote access. – SSH.
9. ```ip domain-name``` - Configure domain name.
10. Local Authentication.


## 5.4 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot Basic Device Hardening
### Local Authentication
* ```username <username> password <password>``` – Creates a local username and password database.

### Secure password
* ```enable secret <password>```
* ```enable password <password>```
* ```service password-encryption```

### Login Banner
* ```banner login $ <message> $```

### MOTD (Message of The Day) Banner
* ```banner motd $ <message> $```


## 5.5 Perform Device Maintenance
### File system management
* ```dir```
* ```mkdir```
* ```copy```
  * e.g. ```copy flash:c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.152-4.M6.bin flash:old-ios/```
* ```delete```
  * ```delete flash:/old-ios/c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.152-4.M6.bin``` – The result on boot is that there is no ios. This can be bad!

### Password Recovery
A configuration register value of 0x2142 tells the router to bypass any startup-config. This is the default configuration for the lab platform but should not be the default for any production network. The default should be 0x2102 which instructs the router to load the startup-config.

1. Note the configuration register 0x2142.

2. Use Physical 3845 router to do the rest of the lab.
* `config-register 0x2142`
* Reboot and Plug Console.

### Cisco IOS Upgrades and Recovery (SCP, FTP, TFTP, and MD5 Verify)
* `boot system flash:c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.152-4.M6.bin` – Sets the boot image for 2900 router.

## 5.6 Use Cisco IOS tools to troubleshoot and resolve problems
### Ping
```ping <ip>```

### Traceroute
Traceroute is essentially a series of pings with time to live settings such that the sender gets an echo response from every router that it traverses along the path to its destination.
* ```traceroute <dest>```

### Terminal Monitor
```terminal monitor```

### Log Events
* ```show log```
* ```logging buffer``` or ```logging console``` – Can be directed to syslog too.
