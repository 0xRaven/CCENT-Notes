# 3.0 Routing Fundamentals
## 3.1 Describe the Routing Concepts
### Basic Three Steps
1. ARP Lookup
2. ARP Broadcast
3. Sends to Default Gateway

Source | Destination
------------ | ------------ 
Decapsulates Frame | Destinatio Packet in exiting interface buffer ARP cache lookup
Inspects IP | 
If match: Forward to exit interface routing table | If match: Frame rewrite (new Frame, with new source MAC address and destination MAC address)
If no match: Packet is dropped and ICMP message sent back to source | If no match: ARP

## 3.2 Interpret The Components of Routing Table
### Prefix
* NetworkID
* Bits of the network portion

### Network mask 
* Subnet Mask
* CIDR Notation ```/24```
### Next hop
* Next device in the path towards destination.
### Administrative distance
* The ranking of a routing protocol's believability.
### Metric
* Each routing protocol's metric to the destination network. 
### Gateway of last resort
* Where to forward a packet to if there is not a route in the routing table.

## 3.3 Describe How a Routing Table is Populated by Different Routing Information Sources
### Administrative Distance: Routing Protocol Ranking
Protocol | AD
------------ | ------------ 
RIP | 120
OSPF | 110
EIGRP | 90
Static Routing | 1
Directly Connected | 0

## 3.4 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot Inter-VLAN Routing
### CLI Commands: Router on a Stick

</p>

#### On The Switch:
* ```int <interface>```
  * ```switchport mode trunk encapsulation dot1q```
  * ```switchport trunk allowed vlans none```
  * ```switchport trunk allowed vlans add <vlan-id(s)>```
  * ```switchport mode trunk```
#### On The Router:
* ```int <interface>.<sub-interface-number>```
  * ```encapsulation dot1q <vlan-id>``` 
  * ```ip address <address> <sm>```
  * ```int <interface>```
  * ```no shutdown```

### CLI Commands: Switched Virtual Interfaces (Switch Layer 3)
* ```interface vlan <id>```
  * ```ip address <address> <sm>```
* ```ip routing``` - Enables IP routing on layer 3 switch.

## 3.5 Compare and Contrast Static Routing and Dynamic Routing
### Static
* Manually configured on each router.
* Good for networks that don't change often.

### Dynamic
* Run by a routing protocol. 
* If multiple protocols exists on one router the one with the least AD is choosen.
* Good for flexibility and scalability.

## 3.6 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot IPv4 and IPv6 Static Routing
### CLI Commands
**IPv4**
* ```show ip route``` – Showing the routing table.
* ```ip route <destination-network-id> <sm> <next-hop> (on both sides)``` – Specifying a static route.
* ```ip route <destination-network-id> <sm> <next-hop> <metric>``` - Float Static Route (in case of a problem) – It doesn’t enter the routing table until the other route is not available, usually the metric set to ```5```.
* ```ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop>``` – Specify the gateway of last resort.

**IPv6**
* ```ipv6 unicast-routing``` – Enabling IPv6 Routing.
* ```ipv6 address 2001:0:A:2::2/64 <next-hop>``` - IPv6 static route.

## 3.7 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot RIPv2 for IPv4 (Excluding Authentication, Filtering, Manual Summarization, Redistribution)
* ```router rip```
    * ```version 2```
    * ```no auto-summary``` - Don’t convert VLSM to Classful addresses classing
    * ```network <network-id>```
* ```show ip protocols``` – Showing the enabled ip routing protocols.
* ```passive-interface <inerface-name>``` - Turning off “passive interface” – an interface that is not connected to a router. No need to advertise a routing table. Less bandwidth. Not excluded from RIP.
* ```time basic <update-time-in-sec> <invalid-time-in-sec> <hold-time-in-sec> <flush-time-in-sec>```
    * ```<update-time-in-sec>``` - Sending routing updates.
    * ```<invalid-time-in-sec>``` - Listening from source for seconds if it doesn’t hear back it will consider it invalid.
    * ```<hold-time-in-sec>``` - Hold time of invalid routes in the table.
    * ```<flush-time-in-sec>``` - Deleting routes after a specific time.
* ```default-information originate``` - Static routes don’t automatically get advertised by RIP itself. By this command we can advertise those information.
