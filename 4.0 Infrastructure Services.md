# 4.0 Infrastructure Services
## 4.1 Describe DNS Lookup Operation
### DNS: Domain Name System
Resolving Hostname to IP Addresses

### Host
1. Lookup in host table (host file) – Different paths on OSs.
2. DNS Server Lookup

### DNS Server on Router
1. Builds a table that does name resolution
2. Works for that router only.
3. Manually configured.
> Cisco IOS > 12.3 can host a DNS server; Can cause high CPU utilization depending on platform. Not as common, manual configuration.

### DNS Records
* **SOA:** Start of Authority
* **A or AAAA:** Hostname to IP Address
* **MX:** Mail Exchange 
* **NS:** Name Server
* **PTR:** Reverse DNS Lookup
* **CNAME:** Domain Name Alias

## 4.2 Troubleshoot Client Connectivity Issues Involving DNS
### CLI Commands: Setting Up a DNS Server on a Cisco Router
* ```ip dns server```
  * ```ip dns primary <domain> soa <name-server-1> <name-server-2>```
  * ```ip host <name> <ip>```
  * ```ip host <name> <ip>``` 

### CMD Command on Windows
* ```nslookup```

## 4.3 Configure and Verify DHCP on a Router (Excluding Static Reservations)
DHCP is a service that enables hosts to get an IP address dynamically without you having to manually configure them; this is particularly useful where you have hundreds of PCs and laptops and other devices that don’t require static addresses in your network. Some devices you may want to configure statically such as servers and networking equipment and printers but for everything else DHCP is normally a good configuration choice.
### CLI Commands: Setting Up a DHCP Server on a Cisco Router
* ```ip dhcp pool <pool-name>```
  * ```network <ip> <sm>```
  * ```dns-server <ip>```
  * ```domain-name <domain.com>```
  * ```default-router <ip>```
  * ```lease <number-of-days>```
* ```ip dhcp excluded-address <start-ip> <end-ip>```

### CLI Commands: Enabling DHCP on a Client Interface
* ```int <interface-name>```
  * ```ip address dhcp```
  * ```no shut```

## 4.4 Troubleshoot Client- and Router-Based DHCP Connectivity Issues
### Router Based
* ```show ip dhcp binding``` – Showing address assignments from the DHCP server perspective.
* ```show ip dhcp conflict``` – Showing DHCP confilicts.
* ```clear ip dhcp binding <ip>``` – Removing a specific client from DHCP.

### Client Based: Depands on the Client OS
* ```ifconfig```
* ```ipconfig /all```

## 4.5 Configure and Verify NTP Operating in Client/Server Mode
Network time protocol (NTP) has become a key component in network security and management security, although it is not obvious why. When we are tracing through logs to pull together and analyze events from various devices, accurate time throughout our network is incredibly important.

### CLI Commands: Server
* ```config t```
  * ```clock timezone <time-zone>```
  * ```clock summer-time DST reccuring```
  * ```ntp master 1```
  * ```ntp max-associations 10``` – Maximum NTP clients: 10.
  * ```ntp source <interface>```

### CLI Commands: Client
* ```show clock```
* ```show ntp associations```
* ```ntp server <ip>```

## 4.6 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot IPv4 Standard Numbered and Named Access List for Routed Interfaces
### Standard ACLs
* Filter only based on source address or network. 
* The closest that we can put that access list to the destination network that Is the place that standard access list should be.
* We can only have one per access-group per interface per direction (one in and one out)
* ACLs get processed from TOP to BOTTOM. Deny specific hosts first then Permit the others.

### Extended ACLs
* Filter based on source IP/network, destination IP/network, and protocol.
### CLI Commads
* ```access-list <number> <permit-deny> <source-ip>``` – Standard Numbered ACL.
* ```show access-lists``` – Showing ACLs.
* ```access-list <number> permit any``` – *VERY IMPORTANT!* There is an implicit deny at the end of each access list, we will need to include a permit statement, otherwise, everything will be blocked. 
* ```ip access-group <number> <in-out>``` –  Access lists just get defined. It doesn't applied anywhere, so filtering is not yet taking place. We must bind this access list to an interface.
* ```ip access-list extended <name>``` – Named Extended ACL.
* ```ip access-group <name> <in-out>``` – Applying Named Exteneded ACL to Interface.
* ```clear ip access-list counters``` - Clear after getting matches.
* ```show access-list <name>``` - Show specific Named Extended ACL entries (ACEs).
* ```access-list <number> <permit-deny> <protocol> host <source-ip> host <destination-ip>``` – Extended ACL.
  * e.g. FTP
    * ```access-list 110 permit tcp host 192.168.16.10 any eq ftp```
    * ```access-list 110 permit tcp host 192.168.16.10 any eq ftp-data```
  * e.g. ICMP
    * ```access-list 110 deny icmp host 192.168.16.10 host 172.15.0.10```

### CLI Commands: Configuring Access-Lists to Restrict Remote Access
**Configure Remote Access**
* ```line vty 0 15```
  * ```password <password>```
  * ```login```

**Congigure ACL**
* ```ip access-list standard permit-remote```
  * ```permit host <ip>```
  * ```deny any log```

**Apply ACL on Virtual Interface**
* ```line vty 0 15```
  * ```access-class permit-remote in```

## 4.7 Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot Inside Source NAT

### CLI Commands: Static
* ```ip nat inside```
* ```ip nat outside```
* ```ip nat inside source static <private-ip> <public-ip>```
* ```show ip nat translation```
* ```show ip nat stat```
### CLI Commands: Pool (Many to Many)
* ```ip nat pool <pool-name> <start-ip> <end-ip> netmask <sm>```
* ```access-list <number> permit ip <private-network-id> <wildcard> <public-netowrk-id> <wild-card>```
  * e.g. ```access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.16.0 0.0.0.255 172.14.0.0 0.0.0.255```
* ```ip nat inside source list <number> pool <pool-name>```
### CLI Commands: PAT (Port Address Translation)
* ```access-list <number> permit ip <private-network-id> <wildcard> any```
* ```ip nat inside source list <number> interface <interface> overload```
* ```debug ip nat detailed```
* ```undebug all```
